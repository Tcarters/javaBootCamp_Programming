>    Variables
Basically there are two types of variables
 + Primitive 
 + Reference

A variable is a name of memory location

There are three types:
``` 
 - local variable
 - Instance Variables
 - Static variable

```

> ** Static Variables ** :
    - When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of the variable is created and shared among all objects at a class level. 
            Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.
    - It can't be local 
    - You can create a single copy os static variable and share aong all the instances of data class
    - It happens only when the class is loaded in the memory.


> ** Local Variable ** :
 * Variable declared inside  the body of the method
 * Local variable can not be defined using "static" 


> ** Instance Variable ** :
 - A varibale declared inisde the class but oustside the method
 - It isn't declared as static
