** OOPs Concept **

- OOPs Concept is a paragdim that provides many conecpts such as:
    Inheritance
    Encapsulation
    Abstration
    Polymorphism


Object means ome real world entities. 
Class means group of objects.

Object Oriented programmming is a methodology to code using classes and objects.

> *** Object ***
 - Can be defined as an instance of a class.
 - Contains an Address and takes up space in memory.
 - Other definitions:
    + An object is a real-world entity.
    + An object is a runtime entity.
    + The object is an entity which has state and behavior.
    + The object is an instance of a class.


> ** Class **
 - Collection of objects.
 - It is logical entities.
 - A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object.
 - Class doesn't consume any space.

 > Method
  - Method is like a function, which represents behavior of an Object.
  - Code reusability.
  - Code optimization.


  > ** Static Method**

```
    -> Static method belongs to class, and not to instance of call.
    -> We can create static method by using "static" keyword.
    -> Main advantage of using static method is that, we can call this method without even making objects.
```

> ** Abstract Method **
```
 + Method which does not have it's body.
 + It is always declared in abstract class.
 + We just use abstract keyword.

```

> ** Constructor **

```
    - Constructor is a block of codes similar to a method.
    - It is called as soon as instance of a class is created.
    - At the time of calling Constructor, memory allocation process takes place.
    - Every time when a new object is created, Constructor is called by default atleast once.
    - Default Constructor is called, when no constructor is made.
    
```

> ** Constructor Overloading **
 - Constructor is very similar to method , but without a return type.
 - It can also be overloaded similar to methods
 - Overloading is a technique of having more than one method / constructor with different parameters in it.



> ** Static Keyword **

- It is mainly used for memory management.
- It can be applied to:
    -> Variable (class Variable)
    -> Nexted class
    -> Block 
    -> Method (class method)

> ** Inheritance **
- Inheritance is basically acquiring all the properties of one into other.
- This is a mechanism in which, an object acquires all the properties of a parent object.
- The main idea behind this conecpt is to reuse  the methods and fields.
- This represents IS-A relationship ( Parents child relationship).

+ Type of Inheritance::
    - Single
    - Multilevel
    - Hierarchical (one parent & two children )
